   - Dynamic Confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Instorage Confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Total Confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Dynamic Semi-confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Instorage Semi-confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Total Semi-confined Ground Water Resources (ham)
   - Total Ground Water Availability in the Area (ham)

8. **🌊 WATERSHED & ADMINISTRATIVE ANALYSIS**
   - Watershed District and Category (safe, semi_critical, critical, over_exploited)
   - Administrative divisions (Tehsil, Taluk, Block, Mandal, Village)
   - Watershed-specific management recommendations
   - Local governance and management structure

### **3. Enhanced Response Templates Added**

The prompt now includes specific templates for enhanced responses:

- 🚨 **CRITICAL ALERT**: Highlight over-exploited areas with immediate action required
- 📈 **TREND ANALYSIS**: Show groundwater direction and implications
- 🔬 **QUALITY CONCERN**: Identify water quality issues and treatment needs
- 🏖️ **COASTAL VULNERABILITY**: Special attention for coastal areas
- 💧 **ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL**: Show additional resources under specific conditions
- 📊 **SUSTAINABILITY STATUS**: Categorize based on extraction levels
- 🌧️ **RAINFALL IMPACT**: Analyze rainfall patterns affecting recharge
- 🏗️ **STORAGE ANALYSIS**: Detail confined/unconfined groundwater resources
- 📅 **TEMPORAL TREND**: Show year-wise changes in groundwater levels
- 🌊 **WATERSHED STATUS**: Watershed category requiring specific management

## 📊 **Data Coverage Analysis**

Based on the INGRIS dataset analysis:
- **162,631 records** across **37 states** and **796 districts**
- **15,671 areas (9.6%)** are over-exploited (≥100% extraction)
- **6,327 areas (3.9%)** are critical (90-100% extraction)
- **17,807 areas** have water quality concerns
- **25 coastal areas** need special attention
- **10,879 areas** have additional potential resources

## 🎯 **Expected Improvements**

1. **More Relevant Responses**: Only includes data that actually exists in the INGRIS dataset
2. **Enhanced Criticality Alerts**: Immediate warnings for over-exploited areas
3. **Trend Analysis**: Shows groundwater direction and implications
4. **Quality Concerns**: Identifies water quality issues and treatment needs
5. **Coastal Vulnerability**: Special attention for coastal areas
6. **Sustainability Indicators**: Clear categorization based on extraction levels
7. **Storage Analysis**: Detailed confined/unconfined groundwater resources
8. **Administrative Context**: Local governance and management structure

## ✅ **Verification**

- ✅ Old sections for non-available data have been removed
- ✅ New sections based on available INGRIS data have been added
- ✅ Enhanced response templates have been integrated
- ✅ Prompt structure updated from 7 to 8 mandatory sections
- ✅ All enhancements are based on actual data availability in the INGRIS dataset
