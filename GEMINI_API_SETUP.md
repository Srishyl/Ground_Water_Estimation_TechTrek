# 🔧 Gemini API Setup Guide

## The Problem
Your Gemini API is not working because the `.env` file is missing! This file contains your API keys and is essential for the application to function.

## 🚀 Quick Fix

### Step 1: Create the .env file
Create a file named `.env` in the `Ground_Water_Estimation_TechTrek` folder with the following content:

```bash
# Groundwater Estimation TechTrek - Environment Variables
QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# PyTorch Configuration (to avoid meta tensor issues)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""
TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM=false
HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING=1
HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
```

### Step 2: Get Your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key
5. Replace `your_actual_gemini_api_key_here` in the `.env` file with your real API key

### Step 3: Test Your Setup
Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
python test_gemini_api.py
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"GEMINI_API_KEY not found"**
   - Make sure the `.env` file exists in the correct location
   - Check that the file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt` or similar)

2. **"API Key is still set to placeholder value"**
   - Replace the placeholder text with your actual API key
   - Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes around the key

3. **"Failed to connect to Gemini API"**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check your internet connection
   - Ensure you have API quota remaining

4. **"Authentication error"**
   - Double-check your API key
   - Make sure you're using the correct API key format
   - Verify the API key has proper permissions

### File Location
Make sure your `.env` file is in the correct location:
```
Ground_Water_Estimation_TechTrek/
├── .env                    ← This file should be here
├── app.py
├── app1.py
├── app2.py
├── app3.py
├── app4.py
├── main.py
└── test_gemini_api.py
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

1. **Check .env file exists**: Look for `.env` in the project root
2. **Verify API key format**: Should be a long string starting with letters/numbers
3. **Run test script**: `python test_gemini_api.py`
4. **Check for errors**: Look for any error messages in the output

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once your Gemini API is working:

1. **Run the main application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app3.py
   ```

2. **Test multilingual features**:
   - Try asking questions in different languages
   - Use the language selector in the sidebar

3. **Check status indicators**:
   - Look for green checkmarks in the sidebar
   - Verify all components are working

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still having problems:

1. **Check the test script output** for specific error messages
2. **Verify your API key** is correct and active
3. **Check your internet connection**
4. **Look at the application logs** when running the main app

The test script (`test_gemini_api.py`) will give you detailed information about what's wrong and how to fix it.

## 🎉 Success!

When everything is working, you should see:
- ✅ API Key found
- ✅ Gemini API is working correctly
- ✅ Response from the API test

Your Gemini API is now ready to use! 🚀
