# Marathi Language Fix Summary

## Issue
The system was not providing data for Marathi queries (like "GROUND WATER ESTIMATION IN KARNATAKA BANGALORE 2016" in Marathi) even though the same query in English was working correctly.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Location Name Translation**: Marathi location names like "कर्नाटक" (Karnataka) and "बेंगळुरू" (Bangalore) were not being properly translated to English for location extraction
2. **Location Extraction Logic**: The location extraction was only looking for exact matches, missing partial matches
3. **Insufficient Fallback Mechanisms**: The search fallback wasn't aggressive enough to find data when location extraction failed

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Location Name Mapping
Added comprehensive mapping of Indian state and city names from Marathi/Hindi to English:

```python
location_mapping = {
    'कर्नाटक': 'Karnataka',
    'बेंगळुरू': 'Bangalore',
    'बंगळुरू': 'Bangalore',
    'महाराष्ट्र': 'Maharashtra',
    'तमिळनाडू': 'Tamil Nadu',
    # ... and many more states and cities
}
```

### 2. Improved Location Extraction
Enhanced the location extraction logic to use both exact and partial matching:

```python
# Exact match
if re.search(r'\b' + re.escape(str(state)) + r'\b', translated_query, re.IGNORECASE):
    target_state = state
    st.info(f"✅ Found exact state match: {state}")
    break
# Partial match
elif str(state).lower() in translated_query.lower():
    target_state = state
    st.info(f"✅ Found partial state match: {state}")
    break
```

### 3. Enhanced Debug Information
Added detailed debugging to show:
- What query is being searched for locations
- Which states/districts are found
- Available states when no match is found

### 4. Aggressive Fallback Search
Added multiple levels of fallback search:

1. **Level 1**: Search with location filters
2. **Level 2**: Search without location filters
3. **Level 3**: Search with basic query (no expansion)
4. **Level 4**: Search with original query (before translation)
5. **Level 5**: Search with generic groundwater keywords

### 5. Pre-processing Query Translation
Modified `translate_query_to_english()` to:
1. First replace Marathi location names with English equivalents
2. Then translate the rest of the query
3. This ensures location names are preserved during translation

## Expected Results
- Marathi queries should now properly extract location information
- The system should find data for Karnataka/Bangalore even when queried in Marathi
- Better debugging information to understand what's happening during search
- More robust fallback mechanisms to ensure data is always found

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Run the app: `streamlit run app3.py`
2. Select Marathi as the language
3. Ask: "कर्नाटक बेंगळुरू 2016 भूजल अनुमान" (Ground water estimation in Karnataka Bangalore 2016)
4. The system should now find and display data for Bangalore

## Files Modified
- `app3.py`: Enhanced location extraction, translation, and fallback mechanisms
