# Comprehensive Groundwater Summary Guide

## Overview

The groundwater summary functionality provides clear, concise key findings about groundwater resources in any region. It includes three critical components as requested:

1. **Basis of Groundwater Availability** - Sources like rainfall, surface irrigation, and other recharge mechanisms
2. **Major Uses of Groundwater Extraction** - Cultivation, non-cultivation, domestic, and industrial uses
3. **Groundwater Safety Category** - Safe, Semi-Critical, Critical, or Over-Exploited classification

## Key Features

### üìä Comprehensive Data Analysis
- **Rainfall Dependency Analysis**: Calculates percentage contribution of rainfall to total recharge
- **Recharge Source Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of all recharge sources
- **Extraction Use Distribution**: Percentage breakdown of groundwater use by category
- **Safety Category Classification**: Automatic categorization based on extraction levels

### üéØ Clear Key Findings Format
- **Bullet-pointed summaries** for easy reading
- **Visual indicators** (emojis) for quick status identification
- **Quantitative data** with proper units (ham, ha.m, mm, %)
- **Qualitative assessments** for context and understanding

    },
    "summary_bullets": [
      "üìç Location: Bangalore, Karnataka (Assessment Year: 2023)",
      "üíß Groundwater Availability: Primarily dependent on rainfall (850.5 mm) contributing 75.2% of total recharge",
      "üåæ Major Use: Agricultural cultivation accounts for 78.5% of total groundwater extraction",
      "‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Status: Critical üî¥ - Groundwater resources are critically stressed",
      "üìä Extraction Level: 95.2% of available resources, with 1250.3 ham remaining for future use"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 2. Coordinate-Based Summary
```
GET /ingres/groundwater-summary-by-coordinates?lat={latitude}&lon={longitude}
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/ingres/groundwater-summary-by-coordinates?lat=12.9716&lon=77.5946"
```

## Safety Category Classifications

| Category | Extraction Stage | Emoji | Description |
|----------|------------------|-------|-------------|
| **Safe** | < 70% | üü¢ | Groundwater resources are within sustainable limits |
| **Semi-Critical** | 70-90% | üü° | Groundwater resources are approaching critical levels |
| **Critical** | 90-100% | üî¥ | Groundwater resources are critically stressed |
| **Over-Exploited** | > 100% | ‚ö´ | Groundwater extraction exceeds recharge capacity |

## Data Sources

The summary function analyzes the following key data points:

### Groundwater Availability Basis
- `Annual Ground water Recharge (ham) - Total - Total`
- `Rainfall (mm) - Total - Total`
- `Rainfall Recharge (ham) - Total - Total`
- `Recharge from Surface Irrigation (ham) - Total - Total`
- `Recharge from Other Sources (ham) - Total - Total`

### Major Extraction Uses
- `Ground Water Extraction for all uses (ha.m) - Total - Total`
- `Ground Water Extraction for all uses (ha.m) - Total - C` (Cultivation)
- `Ground Water Extraction for all uses (ha.m) - Total - NC` (Non-Cultivation)
- `Ground Water Extraction for all uses (ha.m) - Total - Domestic`
- `Ground Water Extraction for all uses (ha.m) - Total - Industrial`

### Safety Category Calculation
- `Stage of Ground Water Extraction (%) - Total - Total`
- `Net Annual Ground Water Availability for Future Use (ham) - Total - Total`

## Usage Examples

### Python Integration
```python
from main import generate_comprehensive_groundwater_summary
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('master_groundwater_data.csv')

# Get record for specific district
record = df[(df['STATE'] == 'Karnataka') & (df['DISTRICT'] == 'Bangalore')].iloc[0]

# Generate summary
summary = generate_comprehensive_groundwater_summary(record)

# Access key findings
print(f"Safety Category: {summary['key_findings']['groundwater_safety_category']['category']}")
print(f"Rainfall Dependency: {summary['key_findings']['groundwater_availability_basis']['rainfall_dependency']}")
```

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Fetch groundwater summary
const response = await fetch('/ingres/groundwater-summary/Karnataka/Bangalore');
const data = await response.json();

// Display summary bullets
data.summary.summary_bullets.forEach(bullet => {
    console.log(bullet);
});

// Access specific data
const safetyCategory = data.summary.key_findings.groundwater_safety_category.category;
const cultivationPercentage = data.summary.key_findings.major_extraction_uses.cultivation.percentage;
```

## Testing

Run the test script to see the functionality in action:

```bash
