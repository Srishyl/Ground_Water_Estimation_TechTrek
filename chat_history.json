            "content": "Groundwater estimation for Bangalore (both Rural and Urban districts) in Karnataka, based on the provided data, reveals the following:\n\n\n**Bangalore Rural:**\n\nThe data spans 2021-2024.  Average annual rainfall across these years was approximately 881.76 mm.  Average annual groundwater recharge was 19,622.34 ham, primarily from rainfall (average 13,630 ham) with additional contributions from groundwater irrigation, tanks/ponds, and water conservation structures.  Average annual extractable groundwater resources were 17,608.26 ham.  Average annual groundwater extraction for all uses was 25,053 ham, resulting in an average stage of groundwater extraction of approximately 149.8%.  Note that Net Annual Groundwater Availability for Future Use is 0 ham across all years.  Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer averaged 18,112.11 ham.\n\n**Bangalore Urban:**\n\nFor 2023, rainfall was 784.70 mm.  Groundwater recharge was 31,739.53 ham,  with significant contributions from rainfall, groundwater irrigation, tanks/ponds, water conservation structures, and pipelines. Annual extractable groundwater resources were 28,565.58 ham. Groundwater extraction for all uses totaled 53,332.51 ham, indicating a groundwater extraction stage of 186.7%.  Net Annual Groundwater Availability for Future Use was 0 ham.  Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was 28,565.58 ham.\n\n\n**Important Note:** The extremely high percentage of groundwater extraction in both rural and urban areas indicates significant over-extraction, exceeding the available resources.  The zero value for Net Annual Groundwater Availability for Future Use suggests a critical situation requiring immediate attention and management strategies."

Note that this is likely an error in the data, as 0 rainfall is highly improbable.\n* **2019:** Total rainfall: 793.9 mm.
