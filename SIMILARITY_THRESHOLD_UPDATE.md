# Similarity Threshold Update - 0.3 Implementation

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Threshold Value**
- Changed `MIN_SIMILARITY_SCORE` from `0.5` to `0.3` in `main.py` (line 55)

### 2. **Applied Threshold in Hybrid Search**
- **Dense Retrieval Filtering**: Added threshold filter in `search_excel_chunks()` function
  - Filters Qdrant results to only include scores ≥ 0.3
  - Applied at lines 740-741

- **Hybrid Scoring Filtering**: Added threshold check in hybrid search results
  - Filters combined scores to only include results ≥ 0.3
  - Applied at lines 780-789

### 3. **Applied Threshold in Reranking**
- **Reranking Filter**: Added threshold check in `re_rank_chunks()` function
  - Filters reranked results to only include scores ≥ 0.3
  - Applied at lines 831-832

## 🔍 **Where Threshold is Applied**

### **Hybrid Search (`search_excel_chunks`)**
1. **Dense Retrieval**: Filters Qdrant vector search results
2. **Hybrid Scoring**: Filters combined dense + sparse scores
3. **Result Selection**: Only returns results above threshold

### **Reranking (`re_rank_chunks`)**
1. **Semantic Similarity**: Filters cosine similarity scores
2. **Final Results**: Only returns reranked results above threshold

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### **Test Query**: "groundwater availability in Karnataka"
- ✅ **Hybrid Search**: 20 results, all above 0.3 threshold
- ✅ **Reranking**: 3 results, all above 0.3 threshold
- ✅ **Edge Case**: Low-similarity query returns no results (correct behavior)

### **Score Ranges Observed**
- **Hybrid Search**: 0.500 - 0.991
- **Reranking**: 0.556 - 0.567
- **All results**: Above 0.3 threshold ✅

## 📊 **Impact of Lower Threshold (0.3 vs 0.5)**

### **Benefits**
- **More Results**: Lower threshold allows more relevant results to pass through
- **Better Coverage**: Captures moderately relevant documents that might be useful
- **Improved Recall**: Reduces false negatives in search results

### **Quality Assurance**
- **Still Filtered**: Irrelevant results (score < 0.3) are still filtered out
- **Maintained Precision**: High-quality results still prioritized
- **Balanced Approach**: Good balance between recall and precision

## 🚀 **Usage**

The threshold is now automatically applied in:
- All hybrid search operations
- All reranking operations
- Both dense (vector) and sparse (BM25) retrieval

No additional configuration needed - the system will automatically filter results based on the 0.3 similarity threshold.

## ✅ **Verification**

Run the test script to verify implementation:
```bash
python test_similarity_threshold.py
```

Expected output: All tests should pass with threshold working correctly.
