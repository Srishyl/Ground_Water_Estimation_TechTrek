    "content": "Groundwater estimation for Delhi in 2021, by district, shows the following:\n\n**Nazul Land:**  Annual extractable groundwater resource was 608.53 ham.  Groundwater extraction totaled 416.20 ham (68.39% of the extractable resource).  Net annual groundwater availability for future use was 192.33 ham.  Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was 608.53 ham.  Additional potential resources under specific conditions (waterlogged/shallow water table and flood prone areas) totalled 19665.06 ham.\n\n**North:** Annual extractable groundwater resource was 4486.72 ham. Groundwater extraction totaled 4540.58 ham (101.2% of the extractable resource, indicating over-extraction). Net annual groundwater availability for future use was 217.38 ham. Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was 4486.72 ham. Additional potential resources under specific conditions (waterlogged/shallow water table) were 9.49 ham.\n\n**North West:** Annual extractable groundwater resource was 3516.31 ham. Groundwater extraction totaled 2373.33 ham (67.49% of the extractable resource). Net annual groundwater availability for future use was 1094.98 ham. Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was 3516.31 ham. Additional potential resources under specific conditions (waterlogged/shallow water table) were 1148.6 ham.\n\n**North East:** Annual extractable groundwater resource was 1708.21 ham. Groundwater extraction totaled 1683.63 ham (98.56% of the extractable resource). Net annual groundwater availability for future use was 142.01 ham. Total groundwater availability in the unconfined aquifer was 1708.21 ham. Additional potential resources under specific conditions (waterlogged/shallow water table) were 31.65 ham.\n\n\nNote that  \"ham\" is the unit of measurement for groundwater resources and extraction, but the meaning of this abbreviation is not provided in the data.  Also note that several districts show extraction exceeding available resources.  Data for 2019 for Nazul Land is also included, but a complete multi-year comparison across all districts was not requested."
