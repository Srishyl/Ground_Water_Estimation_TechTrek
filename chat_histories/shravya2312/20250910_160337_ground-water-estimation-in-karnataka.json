The average total groundwater extraction for all uses is 49,973.3 ham. The average stage of groundwater extraction is 96.76%.  There are significant differences between the 'C' (Command Area) and 'NC' (Non-Command Area) components of these metrics in every year.  Note that the data shows consistently higher groundwater extraction rates in the Non-Command Area compared to the Command Area.  Further, Inflows and Outflows are reported as 0.0 ham in every year.\n\n**Gadag District:** For 2021, the annual groundwater recharge was 30,329 ham, with an extractable resource of 27,296 ham. Groundwater extraction totaled 23,820 ham, resulting in a 87.26% extraction stage.  Similar to Davanagere, Inflows and Outflows are reported as 0.0 ham for this year."
