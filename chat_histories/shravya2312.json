This limits the scope of a complete analysis.  The \"Net Annual Ground Water Availability for Future Use\" is consistently 0, suggesting a significant groundwater deficit across all years.  The high percentage of groundwater extraction relative to availability also indicates substantial stress on the aquifer."
